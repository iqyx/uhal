uHAL - yet another HAL
=================================

(work in progress)

uHAL is a (originally STM32) hardware abstraction layer which does not fear to break old concepts and
does the thing in a more modular and modern way. It uses many methods and patterns known from the
object-oriented world, such as very loose dependencies between the modules, dependency injection,
strictly defined interfaces, etc. It is a set of concepts and methods for writing interfaces and
HAL modules/services.

uHal is a high level HAL, it doesn't allow you to communicate with the hardware directly. However, it
contains a set of ready-made modules which use libopencm3 for this purpose instead.
