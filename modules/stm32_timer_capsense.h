/**
 * There are various ways of doing capacitance measurement (capacitive
 * sensing) - all with their pros and cons. One of the simplest methods
 * is using a single electrode (with ground acting as a second electrode
 * of the capacitor) which is being charged with a constant current source
 * and measuring the time it takes to charge to a predefined voltage.
 * Even a simple resistor connected to a constant voltage source can be
 * used (in this case - VDD).
 *
 * This code uses a single timer with two channels. The first channel is
 * configured as a compare output with its GPIO mode set to open-drain.
 * This GPIO is used to continuously reset the electrode potential back
 * to ground. The second channel is configured as a capture input
 * (sensitive to the signal leading edge) and it is used to measure the
 * time it takes to charge the electrode to a constant, but mostly unknown
 * value (somewhere between GND and VDD, it depends on the MCU input pin
 * circuitry). If required, an external comparator can be used to accurately
 * trigger the input capture when a known voltage is reached. The captured
 * value is used to compute the time and capacitance between the electrode
 * and ground.
